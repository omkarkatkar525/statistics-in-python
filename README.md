Que 1: 	The current age (in years) of 400 clerical employees at an insurance claims processing center is normally distributed with mean  = 38 and Standard deviation  =6. For each statement below, please specify True/False. If false, briefly explain why.
A.	More employees at the processing center are older than 44 than between 38 and 44.
Ans:  False 
Probability of employees at the processing center are older than 44 : 15.86%
Probability of employees at the processing center are between 38 and 44 : 34.13% 
B.	A training program for employees under the age of 30 at the center would be expected to attract about 36 employees.
Ans: True

Que 2 :4.	Let X ~ N(100, 202). Find two values, a and b, symmetric about the mean, such that the probability of the random variable taking a value between them is 0.99. 

Que 3: 5.	Consider a company that has two different divisions. The annual profits from the two divisions are independent and have distributions Profit1 ~ N(5, 32) and Profit2 ~ N(7, 42) respectively. Both the profits are in $ Million. Answer the following questions about the total profit of the company in Rupees. Assume that $1 = Rs. 45
A.	Specify a Rupee range (centered on the mean) such that it contains 95% probability for the annual profit of the company.
Ans: Range is Rs (99.00810347848784, 980.9918965215122) in Millions.
B.	Specify the 5th percentile of profit (in Rupees) for the company
Ans: 5th percentile of profit is 170.0
C.	Which of the two divisions has a larger probability of making a loss in a given year?
Ans: Division 1(0.0477) is having more probability of making more loss.

Que 4 : Auditors at a small community bank randomly sample 100 withdrawal transactions made during the week at an ATM machine located near the bank’s main branch. Over the past 2 years, the average withdrawal amount has been $50 with a standard deviation of $40. Since audit investigations are typically expensive, the auditors decide to not initiate further investigations if the mean transaction amount of the sample is between $45 and $55. What is the probability that in any given week, there will be an investigation?
